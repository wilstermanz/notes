# Considerations for chef knife purchase for Nick's Birthday
When considering a chef's knife as a gift there are several things that we should consider. First, and most importantly, we need to decide on a budget. I feel that $200-$250 is a fair budget, especially if everyone (including parents) are willing to pitch in.

Now that a rough budget is established, here are some considerations, please let me know if you feel differently about any of this.

## Western- or Japanese-style knife?
### Western knives
- Uses softer steels and have thicker edge geometry
- Suitable for heavy use and abuse, but need more frequent sharpening
- General sharpening is easier and a honing steel can be used to maintain a decent edge
- Cannot be made exceptionally sharp
- Not cool, very utilitarian
### Japanese knives
- Uses quite hard steels and have a very thin edge
- Exceptional at slicing and maintaining sharpness, but very prone to chips and damage
- Sharpening is more difficult, and honing steels are more likely to chip the knife than maintain the edge
- Can be sharpened to a ridiculous degree
- Super cool and trendy and available with fancy damascus patterns and nifty handles
### Conclusion
Based on general cool factor and the examples Nick sent, a Japanese-style knife is the way to go. This is especially true if we choose one with some Western-style features like slightly lower hardness steel and more friendly edge geometry

## Budget Breakdown
Because of the limitations I listed for Japanese knives, I think that it would be worth getting one that is a bit cheaper, but we can also get some other gifts that will make up for its deficiencies such as an end-grain cutting board (to protect the edge) and whetstone (also, Nick likes more gifts more than less gifts). Here are some options in various price ranges:
